Introduction ::: Introducing the problem:
-----------------------------------------
What words mean is highly influenced by the surrounding contexts in which the two pairs of words co-occur together in a given sentence. The two pair of words occurring in different contexts usually carry different senses. It is important to identify and distinguish the differences between the words relatedness and similarity. 

Our task is to compute the similarity between the two pairs of words that occur together within different contexts and in addition study how the effect of a particular context plays a role in the similarity score.

Goal: to build embedding models that predict the effect context has on the human predicted scores.
----

This is an unsupervised task, so there will be no training & testing data available to perform the validation methods. 

Evaluation: Spearman's Correlation against the human annotated scores (gold-standard data) ----- (specified by Task Organizers)

Example of the problem:
------------------------

(From Codalab):

Given data: two pair of words, two contexts, simlex score

---EXAMPLE 1----
Two pair of words: Room and Cell 

Context 1: 
Her prision cell was almost an improvement over her room at the last hostel.


Context 2
His job as a biologist didn't leave much room for a personal life. He knew much more about human cells than about human feelings.


==> We can see that Room & Cell in Context 1 carries a different meaning vs. in Context 2. Additionally, 'Room' & 'Cell' individually carried distinct meanings in the same contexts, for instance in Context 2.

Implementation Brief Overview

- First Embedding Model Implemented:  elMo Word Embedding Model in Python

- Similarity Score used: Cosine Distance      
     -> To get cosine similarity measure = we computed (1 - cosine distance)
